            <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was born into a Sikh family on <em> 27th September 1907</em> in the village of <em>  Lyallpur district of the Punjab</em> 
            in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters born to Vidyavati 
            and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, 
            taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914-1915.
            After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.
            In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, 
            which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.
            Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing 
            that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest.
            He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha
            that excoriated the British.He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper,
            published in Delhi.He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.
            Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day. His memory, however, 
            defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it. Pritam Singh, a professor who has specialised in the study of federalism, 
            nationalism and development in India, notes that Bhagat Singh represents a challenge to almost every tendency in Indian politics. 
            Gandhi-inspired Indian nationalists, Hindu nationalists, Sikh nationalists, the parliamentary Left and 
            the pro-armed struggle Naxalite Left compete with each other to appropriate the legacy of Bhagat Singh, and yet each one of them is faced with a contradiction 
            in making a claim to his legacy. Gandhi-inspired Indian nationalists find Bhagat Singh's resort to violence problematic, 
            the Hindu and Sikh nationalists find his atheism troubling, the parliamentary Left finds his ideas and actions as more close to the perspective of the Naxalites and 
            the Naxalites find Bhagat Singh's critique of individual terrorism in his later life an uncomfortable historical fact.
            On 15 August 2008, an 18-foot tall bronze statue of Singh was installed in the Parliament of India, 
            next to the statues of Indira Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose.A portrait of Singh and Dutt also adorns the walls of the Parliament House.

            The place where Singh was cremated, at Hussainiwala on the banks of the Sutlej river, became Pakistani territory during the partition. 
            On 17 January 1961, it was transferred to India in exchange for 12 villages near the Sulemanki Headworks.
            Batukeshwar Dutt was cremated there on 19 July 1965 in accordance with his last wishes, as was Singh's mother, Vidyawati.
            The National Martyrs Memorial was built on the cremation spot in 1968 and has memorials of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. 
            During the 1971 India-Pakistan war, the memorial was damaged and the statues of the martyrs were removed by the Pakistani Army. 
            They have not been returned but the memorial was rebuilt in 1973.
            The Shaheedi Mela (Punjabi: Martyrdom Fair) is an event held annually on 23 March when people pay homage at the National Martyrs Memorial. 
            The day is also observed across the Indian state of Punjab.
            The Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Museum opened on the 50th anniversary of his death at his ancestral village, Khatkar Kalan. 
            Exhibits include Singh's ashes, the blood-soaked sand, and the blood-stained newspaper in which the ashes were wrapped.
            A page of the first Lahore Conspiracy Case's judgement in which Kartar Singh Sarabha was sentenced to death and on which Singh put some notes is also displayed, 
            as well as a copy of the Bhagavad Gita with Bhagat Singh's signature, which was given to him in the Lahore Jail, and other personal belongings.
            The Bhagat Singh Memorial was built in 2009 in Khatkar Kalan at a cost of ₹168 million (US$2.1 million).
            The Supreme Court of India established a museum to display landmarks in the history of India's judicial system, displaying records of some historic trials. 
            The first exhibition that was organised was the Trial of Bhagat Singh, which opened on 28 September 2007, on the centenary celebrations of Singh's birth.

            The youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh.
            He was voted the "Greatest Indian" in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi.
            During the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals.
            The Parliament of India paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of Singh on 23 March 2001 and 2005.
            In Pakistan, after a long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, 
            where he was hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk. This change was successfully challenged in a Pakistani court. 
            On 6 September 2015, the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to Bhagat Singh Chowk.
